# pytorch-tutorial
A short document containing the basics of Deep Learning with PyTorch. The information present in this notebook is provided by a Pytorch tutorial from Python Engineer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&t=11623s<br>
<br>
This contains a plethora of information including: <br>
1. tensor basics
2. autograd
3. backpropogation
4. manual backprop
5. auto backprop with autograd
6. using a pre-defined model, loss, and optimizer
7. using Dataset and Dataloader classes
8. Dataset transforms
9. Softmax function and Cross Entropy Loss
10. other activation functions
11. and several examples of neural networks
<br><br>
Overall, the material presented is incredibly detailed. It covers everything about Pytorch that one needs to build Deep Learning models. One should use this tutorial if they already have a good handle on deep learning and need a refresher or need to better understand building models with Pytorch
