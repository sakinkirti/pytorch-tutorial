# pytorch-tutorial
A short document containing the basics of Deep Learning with PyTorch. The information present in this notebook is provided by a Pytorch tutorial from Python Engineer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&t=11623s
<br><br>
Overall, the material presented is incredibly detailed. It covers everything about Pytorch that one needs to build Deep Learning models. One should use this tutorial if they already have a good handle on deep learning and need a refresher or need to better understand building models with Pytorch
<br>
This contains a plethora of information including: <br>
1. tensor basics
2. autograd
3. backpropogation
4. manual backprop
5. auto backprop with autograd
6. using a pre-defined model, loss, and optimizer
7. using Dataset and Dataloader classes
8. Dataset transforms
9. Softmax function and Cross Entropy Loss
10. other activation functions
11. a basic neural network
12. conv net example
13. transfer learning
14. a tensor board
15. and saving and loading models
